title: Ionic Framework and hybrid apps
---

For the past couple weeks I've being working in a hybrid app using the (Ionic)[ionicframework.com] framework.
It works by wrapping a bridge between angularJs apps and cordova and creating a hybrid Mobile app.  


## The good: 
Its possible to develop using angular Js.

## The bad: 
There are many differences between the desktop version and the built by cordova. You need to keep constant tests between versions.
