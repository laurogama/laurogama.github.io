Im trying to make the process of writing posts easier, so im giving (atom)[atom.io]
a try.

My first impression is that it is "stupidly" easy to config. In a few seconds I
 installed the Monokai UI theme and some packages like atomatigit.

 Atomatigit is a git integration package that makes it super easy to push changes to my repo on github.
