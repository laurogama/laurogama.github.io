title: Game Development with Libgdx
---

Recently, me and some colleages started studying a library for game development named [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). The real charm of this library is that you can program a main project in plain java and it creates child projects for Android, Html5, Ios and Desktop.

Until now i didnt see any good game made with libgdx but it has potencial and is being actively developed.

The documentation is fragmented because the team is migrating from [google code](https://code.google.com/p/libgdx/) to [github](https://github.com/libgdx/). the best place to get started is in the wiki and tutorials. There are many good tutorials on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/dermetfan%E2%80%8E) made by this guy Dermetfan A funny Nowergian that uses the word "whatever" like a comma.
